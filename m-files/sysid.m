% sysid.m: Implements least squares system identification. The
% method is taken from Gene F. Franklin, J. David Powell, and
% Michael L. Workman. Digital Control of Dynamic Systems.
% Addison-Wesley, 3 edition, 1998, pages 503 -- 505.   
%
% Uses only Euler's approximation. User needs to convert plant TF
% to SS. Works in GNU Octave as well as MATLAB. 
%
% PRECONDITIONS: Tc < Tmin/10. Here, Tmin is the smallest time
% constant of the CL system, and Tc is the period at which the uC
% samples the plant states. In the lab manual Tc is denoted Ts.
